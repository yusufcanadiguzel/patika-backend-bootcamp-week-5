This is the final project for week 5 of the Patika+ Back-End Program. 

Technologies used in the project. They are:
- C#
- .Net Standart

### Purpose
- The purpose is to go over what was covered in all week.

### Requirements

1. Ask to the user if they want to produce a car. If they want the answer should 'e', if not answer should 'h'. Remove case-sensetive. If answer is not valid, give an error to the console and ask the question again.
2. If answer is no terminate the program. If answer is yes, create a car object and ask for properties to the user.
3. Manufacture Date is automatically assigned when creating the object.
4. If user tries assign to non-numeric character to Door Count prevent program from throwing an exception. Write an error message to the console and redirect the user to the assign phase. (research goto keyword)
5. Create a list and add created car object to the list.
6. Ask to the user if they want to create another car. If answer is yes return the step 2. If answer is no, then list all created cars with Serial Numbers and Brands.
